# Pick

 Pick is able to search sites in your Pocket and open browser.

## Installation

``` sh
go get -u github.com/tMinamiii/pick
```

## Usage

### Auth Pocket

``` sh
pick keygen <Pocket Consumer Key>
```

### Run Pick

``` sh
pick
```

## Motivation

 Pocket is one of very useful service, however we keep storing favorite
or read later site.  We often only add site and never visit it. Pick helps
search titles ( and contets if you are premium user ) in your Pocket sites and
open browser directly.
